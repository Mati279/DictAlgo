# DictAlgo
 DictAlgo is an app developed in Max MSP that based on data models driven by musical analysis of classical authors creates music dictations so that students can practice at home.


## Overview

DictAlgo is an innovative application designed to aid music students in their training by generating melodic and harmonic dictations algorithmically. Developed in the Max MSP language, DictAlgo leverages sophisticated algorithms based on data derived from musical analysis to provide dynamic and personalized musical exercises.

## Features

- **Melodic Dictation:** Generates melodic sequences for students to transcribe.
- **Harmonic Dictation:** Provides harmonic progressions for ear training and transcription practice.
- **Personalized Exercises:** Customizable difficulty levels and exercise parameters to suit individual learning needs.

## Current Status

DictAlgo is currently in the beta testing phase. While it is being used domestically and in lessons by numerous music students, we are continually working to improve the application based on user feedback and testing results.
